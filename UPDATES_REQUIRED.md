this application works well but the images that load in CameraCard are hardcoded.  it's time to launch this HMI to the remote machine that is already taking images and saving to our DB.

our current DB schema is at the file schema_dump.sql.  i also have an .sql that has the entire db's last 100 rows so you can get a feel for what all the data looks like located at final_export_fixed.sql

we need to create a backend for this application that allows it to serve the production machine.

the required tasks (please let me know if you think of any that I am missing)

1) build a python backend that connects to the db with a config.yaml
2) have this backend instead of hard coding the images and defects in the CameraCard front end page, pull the most recent Trigger and display the Images from the cameras
3) get rid of the random pass fail overlay logic and actually pull in results from the Defects table in order to overlay
4) apply this same functionality to the expanded camera page but just for it's function
5) in the expanded camera page, integrate the reading/writing from the DB for the 

  1. Core fields from the component:
    - camera_id: Foreign key to the Cameras table (matches serial_number)
    - region_id: User-defined region name/identifier as shown in UI
    - size_threshold: Stores the minimum size for defects (in mm)
    - density_threshold: Number of proximate defects to trigger a density failure
    - proximity_threshold: Maximum distance (in mm) between defects to be considered a cluster
    - polygon: Stores the polygon points as a JSONB array (for the drawn region)
  2. Additional recommended fields:
    - part_number: Optional link to Part_Information for part-specific regions
    - created_at and updated_at: Timestamp tracking
    - active: Boolean flag to enable/disable regions without deletion
    - description: Optional field for notes about the region's purpose

6) modify the defect selection functionality to read/write the displosition per defect to the Defects table.

let's start here and see where we get.
