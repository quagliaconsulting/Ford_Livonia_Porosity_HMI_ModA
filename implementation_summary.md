# Ford Livonia Porosity HMI Implementation Summary

This document provides a summary of tasks, deliverables, and implementation guidance for connecting the Ford Livonia Porosity HMI to the production database.

## Backend Deliverables

1. **Python FastAPI Backend**
   - SQLAlchemy ORM models mapped to existing database schema
   - CRUD operations for all required data
   - API endpoints for cameras, images, defects, and regions
   - Configuration via YAML file
   - Image serving capability
   - Defect analysis services

2. **Database Enhancements**
   - New Regions table for storing inspection regions
   - Support for defect disposition tracking
   - Integration with existing Cameras, Images, and Defects tables

3. **API Documentation**
   - Swagger documentation at `/docs` endpoint
   - README with setup instructions and endpoint documentation

## Frontend Deliverables

1. **API Service Layer**
   - Base API service for HTTP requests
   - Domain-specific services (cameras, images, defects, regions)
   - Error handling and response processing

2. **Component Updates**
   - Replace hardcoded data with API calls in CameraCard
   - Replace random pass/fail with real defect data
   - Update ExpandedCameraModal to use regions from the database
   - Implement defect disposition saving to database
   - Add loading states and error handling

3. **Development Configuration**
   - Vite proxy setup for local development
   - Environment-specific configurations

## Implementation Steps

### Backend Implementation

   - Add transaction support
   - Implement efficient queries

4. **API Endpoints**
   - Create RESTful endpoints for all required data
   - Implement validation with Pydantic
   - Add error handling and status codes

5. **Services Layer**
   - Implement image processing services
   - Create defect analysis services
   - Add region-based analysis

6. **Testing**
   - Unit tests for core functionality
   - Integration tests for API endpoints
   - Performance testing

### Frontend Implementation

1. **API Integration**
   - Create API service layer
   - Implement error handling
   - Add domain-specific services

2. **CameraCard Update**
   - Replace hardcoded image paths with API calls
   - Replace random status with real defect data
   - Add error handling and loading states

3. **ExpandedCameraModal Updates**
   - Replace localStorage with API calls for regions
   - Implement defect disposition saving
   - Update region drawing/editing to save to database

4. **Testing**
   - Test all API integrations
   - Verify region persistence
   - Test defect disposition workflow

## Testing and Deployment Plan

1. **Local Development**
   - Run backend and frontend locally
   - Use Vite proxy for API calls
   - Test with development database

2. **Integration Testing**
   - Test frontend against production backend
   - Verify all database operations
   - Test image loading and processing

3. **Deployment**
   - Deploy backend to production server
   - Configure database connection
   - Set up image storage
   - Deploy frontend with production build

4. **Monitoring**
   - Add logging for API requests
   - Monitor database performance
   - Set up error reporting

## Key Technical Considerations

1. **Database Performance**
   - Optimize queries for large image datasets
   - Consider caching for frequently accessed data
   - Monitor connection pooling

2. **Image Handling**
   - Ensure efficient image loading and serving
   - Consider caching for frequently accessed images
   - Implement proper error handling for missing images

3. **Real-time Updates**
   - Consider polling vs WebSockets for updates
   - Balance update frequency with server load
   - Implement efficient client-side state management

4. **Security**
   - Implement authentication for sensitive operations
   - Validate all user inputs
   - Protect against common web vulnerabilities

5. **Error Handling**
   - Provide meaningful error messages
   - Implement graceful fallbacks
   - Log errors for troubleshooting
